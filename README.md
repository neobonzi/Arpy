Arpy
====

Arpy is an algorithmic music generator written in python that was created for a course at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

Arpy is LIVE and requires middleware capable of receiving messages from rtmidi. It has only been tested with JACK but the midi messages will be sent to any open midi port.

Simply run ArpGui using python to bring up the gui. Pick a tonic, number of bars, mode, and pick a delay between notes and click start to begin the magic!
